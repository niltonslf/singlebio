          <h2>Why do we process your data?</h2>

          <p>
            Our top priority is the security of users' personal data, and
            therefore, we process only minimal data, only as necessary for the
            maintenance of the site. Automatically collected information is used
            to identify potential abuse cases and establish statistical data
            about the use of the site. These statistical data are not aggregated
            in ways that allow the identification of specific system users.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can visit the site without revealing who you are or disclosing
            any information that could be used by others to identify you
            individually. However, if you wish to use any of the site's
            features, receive our newsletter, or provide additional details
            through form submission, you may need to provide personal data such
            as your email, name, last name, city of residence, organization, and
            phone number. You can choose not to provide personal data, but in
            doing so, you may not be able to use some site features. For
            example, you won't be able to receive our newsletter or contact us
            directly through our site. Users unsure about which personal
            information is mandatory are invited to contact us at the email
